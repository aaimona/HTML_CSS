# the basic structure of HTML website:
<!DOCTYPE html> # this tag is single and therefore doesn't need to be closed by another tag
  <hmtl>
    <head>
      <title>something_written_here</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <p>some_text_in_paragraphs_here</p>
      <p>some_text_in_paragraphs_here</p>
      <p>some_text_in_paragraphs_here</p>
      <img src = "link.jpg">
      <a href = "www.some-link.com">Click here!</a>
    </body>
  </html>

# CSS
# there are two ways of working with CSS. one way is to add CSS code between <style></style> tags, inside <head></head> section.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<style>
			p {
				color: purple;
			}
		</style>
		<title>Result</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>Check it out! I'm purple!</p>
	</body>
</html>

# second way is to write css in a separate file and link it to html document, using <link> tag (no need to close this one).
# <link> needs three attributes: type equal to "text/css", rel equal to "stylesheet" and href equal to the address of css.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
	    <link type = "text/css" rel = "stylesheet" href = "stylesheet.css"/>
	    # since nothing is going between <link> and </link>, i open and close the tag within one pair of brackets
	    # the same goes on for <img> - <img src = "www.w.com"/>
		<title>Result</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>I want to be SIZE 44 font!</p>
	</body>
</html>

# CSS syntax:
selector { # this is any html element, such as <p>, <img>, <span>, just without <>
  property: value; # e.g. color: violet; font-size: 69, font-family: cursive;
}

# "hex color palette" or "hex color picker" - google it to find color shades in hexadecimal values
